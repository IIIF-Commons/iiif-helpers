His hands were dirty \r\nand his hair was messy.\r\n\r\n7\r\n00:00:46.300 --> 00:00:51.100\r\nBut Mr. Bungle didn't stop to wash his hands \r\nor comb his hair.\r\n\r\n8\r\n00:00:51.200 --> 00:00:54.900\r\nHe went right to lunch.\r\n\r\n9\r\n00:00:57.900 --> 00:01:05.700\r\nThen, instead of getting into line at the \r\nlunchroom, Mr. Bungle pushed everyone aside \r\nand went right to the front.\r\n\r\n10\r\n00:01:06.000 --> 00:01:11.800\r\nEven though this made the children laugh, \r\nno one thought that was a fair thing to do.\r\n\r\n11\r\n00:01:11.900 --> 00:01:22.000\r\nThen, in the lunchroom, Mr. Bungle was so \r\nclumsy and impolite that he knocked over \r\neverything.

He wouldn't want to be like \r\nMr. Bungle.\r\n\r\n15\r\n00:01:43.900 --> 00:01:49.100\r\nLater Miss Brown said it was time to for \r\nthe children who ate in the cafeteria to \r\ngo to lunch.\r\n\r\n16\r\n00:01:49.200 --> 00:01:52.500\r\nShe hoped there weren't any Mr. Bungles in \r\nthis room.\r\n\r\n17\r\n00:01:58.500 --> 00:02:03.200\r\nPhil stopped to return a book to Miss Brown \r\nwhile his friends went on to the lunchroom.\r\n\r\n18\r\n00:02:03.700 --> 00:02:05.400\r\nHe would have to catch up with them later.\r\n\r\n19\r\n00:02:08.500 --> 00:02:13.000\r\nOne his way to catch up with his friends, \r\nPhil almost walked passed the boys' room.\r\n\r\n20\r\n00:02:13.300 --> 00:02:16.400\r\nBut he stopped and thought we're his hands \r\nclean?\r\n\r\n21\r\n00:02:16.500 --> 00:02:22.800\r\nNo, they were a little dirty. Phil remembered \r\nthat Mr. Bungle didn't wash his hands.\r\n\r\n22\r\n00:02:22.900 --> 00:02:25.600\r\nMr. Bungle's hair was messy too.\r\n\r\n23\r\n00:02:25.800 --> 00:02:28.000\r\nPhil didn't want to be like Mr. Bungle.\r\n\r\n24\r\n00:02:31.200 --> 00:02:36.900\r\nInside the boys' room, Phil was surprised \r\nto see some of his friends washing their \r\nhands too.\r\n\r\n25\r\n00:02:37.300 --> 00:02:40.900\r\nPhil washed his hands well with lots of soap.\r\n\r\n26\r\n00:02:45.400 --> 00:02:47.800\r\nThen he rinsed the soap off.\r\n\r\n27\r\n00:02:51.700 --> 00:02:58.900\r\nPhil dried his hands well too. When he was \r\nfinished, he threw the paper towel in the \r\nbasket where it belonged.\r\n\r\n28\r\n00:02:59.700 --> 00:03:02.200\r\nAnd then he made sure that his hair looked \r\nneat.\r\n\r\n29\r\n00:03:05.500 --> 00:03:08.500\r\nNow Phil and his friends were ready for lunch.\r\n\r\n30\r\n00:03:17.600 --> 00:03:22.300\r\nThere was a line of children waiting to get \r\ninto the lunchroom when Phil got there.\r\n\r\n31\r\n00:03:22.800 --> 00:03:25.100\r\nHe saw some boys he knew at the front of \r\nthe line.\r\n\r\n32\r\n00:03:25.500 --> 00:03:28.600\r\nThey waved for him to go up to the front \r\nwith them.\r\n\r\n33\r\n00:03:29.600 --> 00:03:33.100\r\nBut Phil didn't want to break into line as \r\nMr. Bungle did.\r\n\r\n34\r\n00:03:34.300 --> 00:03:38.500\r\nSo Phil went to the end. That was the fair \r\nthing to do.\r\n\r\n35\r\n00:03:38.600 --> 00:03:41.500\r\nHe would see his other friends inside the \r\nlunchroom.\r\n\r\n36\r\n00:03:42.600 --> 00:03:46.500\r\nThe line moved very fast, and soon Phil was \r\ninside.\r\n\r\n37\r\n00:03:47.600 --> 00:03:49.200\r\nFirst he picked up his tray.\r\n\r\n38\r\n00:03:55.400 --> 00:03:57.300\r\nThen he got his silverware.\r\n\r\n39\r\n00:03:59.500 --> 00:04:04.300\r\nHe put his knife, fork and spoon neatly on \r\nthe tray.\r\n\r\n40\r\n00:04:05.000 --> 00:04:07.500\r\nAnd then he slid his tray along.\r\n\r\n41\r\n00:04:11.900 --> 00:04:15.300\r\nHe always enjoyed looking at the good food \r\nin the cafeteria.\r\n\r\n42\r\n00:04:15.400 --> 00:04:18.200\r\nIt tasted good and was good for him too.\r\n\r\n43\r\n00:04:18.900 --> 00:04:23.200\r\nInstead of having a sandwich today, Phil \r\ndecided to take the hot lunch.\r\n\r\n44\r\n00:04:26.100 --> 00:04:28.300\r\nPhil took some bread and butter too.\r\n\r\n45\r\n00:04:28.500 --> 00:04:31.600\r\nAnd he knew what else he wanted: milk.\r\n\r\n46\r\n00:04:31.700 --> 00:04:35.600\r\nBut Alice took the last carton on the tray.\r\n\r\n47\r\n00:04:35.700 --> 00:04:40.600\r\nMaybe there was more more milk, so he said, \r\n\"May I please have some milk?\"\r\n\r\n48\r\n00:04:41.100 --> 00:04:45.800\r\nPhil remembered to say \"may I\" and \"please\". \r\nThat was very polite.\r\n\r\n49\r\n00:04:45.900 --> 00:04:48.200\r\nYes, there was more milk.\r\n\r\n50\r\n00:04:51.800 --> 00:04:55.500\r\nPhil remembered to say \"thank you\" when he \r\ntook the carton of milk.\r\n\r\n51\r\n00:04:56.700 --> 00:05:01.000\r\nPhil had good manners. He didn't want to \r\nbe like Mr. Bungle in the lunchroom.\r\n\r\n52\r\n00:05:01.500 --> 00:05:04.400\r\nPhil didn't want to forget his dessert.\r\n\r\n53\r\n00:05:05.100 --> 00:05:08.200\r\nThe cake looked delicious [and was huge!].\r\n\r\n54\r\n00:05:10.600 --> 00:05:15.300\r\nAt the end of the line, the lunchroom supervisor \r\nsaid she had noticed how polite Phil was.\r\n\r\n55\r\n00:05:15.400 --> 00:05:17.000\r\nAnd she smiled at him.\r\n\r\n56\r\n00:05:17.100 --> 00:05:19.400\r\nShe wouldn't smile at a Mr. Bungle.\r\n\r\n57\r\n00:05:20.000 --> 00:05:22.600\r\nPhil went to table where his friends were.\r\n\r\n58\r\n00:05:23.500 --> 00:05:29.700\r\nHe put his tray down carefully, pulled out \r\nhis chair quietly and sat down.\r\n\r\n59\r\n00:05:30.100 --> 00:05:33.600\r\nHe knew his friends would like a noisy Mr. \r\nBungle at their table.\r\n\r\n60\r\n00:05:33.800 --> 00:05:36.900\r\nThere was someone Phil liked: Freddy.\r\n\r\n61\r\n00:05:37.400 --> 00:05:39.700\r\nHe always brought his lunch from home.\r\n\r\n62\r\n00:05:39.800 --> 00:05:40.700\r\nIt looked good.\r\n\r\n63\r\n00:05:41.600 --> 00:05:45.000\r\nFreddy had a sandwich, and apple, a cookie, \r\nand milk.\r\n\r\n64\r\n00:05:48.300 --> 00:05:52.100\r\nBefore Phil began to eat, he always put a \r\nnapkin on his lap.\r\n\r\n65\r\n00:05:52.400 --> 00:05:53.900\r\nSo did Freddy.\r\n\r\n66\r\n00:05:55.100 --> 00:05:58.300\r\nEveryone liked Freddy. He was very polite.\r\n\r\n67\r\n00:05:58.400 --> 00:06:01.900\r\nFor example, if he had food in his mouth \r\nwhen someone talked to him,\r\n\r\n68\r\n00:06:02.000 --> 00:06:07.200\r\nhe always took time to chew the food with \r\nhis mouth closed and swallow before he answered.\r\n\r\n69\r\n00:06:08.900 --> 00:06:12.800\r\nPhil noticed how straight and tall Freddy \r\nusually sat.\r\n\r\n70\r\n00:06:12.900 --> 00:06:15.600\r\nFreddy kept his feet on the floor too.\r\n\r\n71\r\n00:06:18.200 --> 00:06:21.500\r\nPhil would rather be like Freddy than like \r\nMr. Bungle.\r\n\r\n72\r\n00:06:21.600 --> 00:06:25.400\r\nAnother polite person everyone liked was \r\nAlice.\r\n\r\n73\r\n00:06:26.700 --> 00:06:33.200\r\nFor example, when Alice sneezed, she covered \r\nher mouth and nose. This protected her friends \r\nat the table from any germs.\r\n\r\n74\r\n00:06:34.500 --> 00:06:38.000\r\nWhile Phil and his friends ate, a boy ran \r\npast their table.\r\n\r\n75\r\n00:06:38.100 --> 00:06:42.300\r\nYou shouldn't run in the lunchroom. Only \r\nMr. Bungle would do that.\r\n\r\n76\r\n00:06:45.800 --> 00:06:49.400\r\nPhil and his friends wouldn't like to have \r\na Mr. Bungle at their table.\r\n\r\n77\r\n00:06:49.600 --> 00:06:52.400\r\nThen lunchtime wouldn't be as much fun as \r\nit is.\r\n\r\n78\r\n00:06:53.500 --> 00:06:56.100\r\nPhil ate slowly and enjoyed his lunch.\r\n\r\n79\r\n00:06:57.500 --> 00:07:00.400\r\nFinally, he had eaten everything except his \r\ndessert.\r\n\r\n80\r\n00:07:01.000 --> 00:07:03.800\r\nHe saved his cake for last.\r\n\r\n81\r\n00:07:03.900 --> 00:07:07.900\r\nOnly a Mr. Bungle would eat his dessert before \r\nhe'd finished the rest of his lunch.\r\n\r\n82\r\n00:07:08.200 --> 00:07:10.200\r\nAnd Phil wan't a Mr. Bungle.\r\n\r\n83\r\n00:07:11.600 --> 00:07:13.000\r\nThe cake was a lie.\r\n\r\n84\r\n00:07:16.800 --> 00:07:18.300\r\nPhil drank his milk carefully.\r\n\r\n85\r\n00:07:18.800 --> 00:07:22.200\r\nSome children are messy when they drink milk, \r\nbut not Phil.\r\n\r\n86\r\n00:07:24.600 --> 00:07:30.500\r\nAs each of Phil's friends finished, they \r\ndidn't leave the table but waited for all \r\nthe others to finish eating too.\r\n\r\n87\r\n00:07:31.800 --> 00:07:34.500\r\nPhil was the last one done.\r\n\r\n88\r\n00:07:34.600 --> 00:07:37.500\r\nHis wiped his mouth and hands carefully with \r\nhis napkin.\r\n\r\n89\r\n00:07:38.500 --> 00:07:40.500\r\nThen he cleaned the table where he sat.\r\n\r\n90\r\n00:07:41.200 --> 00:07:43.700\r\nHe didn't want to leave his place at the \r\ntable dirty.\r\n\r\n91\r\n00:07:44.800 --> 00:07:52.500\r\nEveryone at the table cleaned his own place \r\nwell. But look at that table. It was left \r\nvery messy.\r\n\r\n92\r\n00:07:53.900 --> 00:07:56.500\r\nPhil thought a Mr. Bungle must have sat there.\r\n\r\n93\r\n00:07:58.200 --> 00:08:04.500\r\nBut Phil didn't want to be like Mr. Bungle \r\nso he put his chair neatly into place.\r\n\r\n94\r\n00:08:05.500 --> 00:08:08.600\r\nAnd his table looked fine.\r\n\r\n95\r\n00:08:09.100 --> 00:08:12.500\r\nNot a piece of paper or scrap of food was \r\nleft on it.\r\n\r\n96\r\n00:08:17.000 --> 00:08:19.500\r\nNo Mr. Bungle sat here!\r\n\r\n97\r\n00:08:21.100 --> 00:08:26.400\r\nPhil's friends were careful to put their \r\nwaste papers and empty milk cartons where \r\nthey belonged.\r\n\r\n98\r\n00:08:27.300 --> 00:08:31.600\r\nIn this way, they helped keep the lunchroom \r\nclean.\r\n\r\n99\r\n00:08:31.900 --> 00:08:37.700\r\nPhil was certain that Mr. Bungle wouldn't \r\nput his paper in the waste basket and his \r\nempty carton on the milk tray.\r\n\r\n100\r\n00:08:38.300 --> 00:08:42.600\r\nMr. Bungle probably wouldn't bother to put \r\nhis lunch tray in the right place either.\r\n\r\n101\r\n00:08:42.700 --> 00:08:47.500\r\nBut Phil and his friends did.\r\n\r\n102\r\n00:08:47.600 --> 00:08:53.500\r\nLunch was good today. And then Miss Brown \r\ntold Phil and his friends how proud she was \r\nof them.\r\n\r\n103\r\n00:08:54.000 --> 00:08:57.300\r\nThey had left their table the neatest in \r\nthe luchroom.\r\n\r\n104\r\n00:08:57.400 --> 00:09:02.200\r\nNo one here was a Mr. Bungle.

        Just before lunch one day, a puppet show 
        was put on at school.
        It was called "Mister Bungle Goes to Lunch".
        It was fun to watch.
        In the puppet show, Mr. Bungle came to the 
        boys' room on his way to lunch.
        He looked at his hands. His hands were dirty 
        and his hair was messy.
        But Mr. Bungle didn't stop to wash his hands 
        or comb his hair.
        He went right to lunch.
        Then, instead of getting into line at the 
        lunchroom, Mr. Bungle pushed everyone aside 
        and went right to the front.
        Even though this made the children laugh, 
        no one thought that was a fair thing to do.
        Then, in the lunchroom, Mr. Bungle was so 
        clumsy and impolite that he knocked over 
        everything. And no one wanted to sit next 
        to him.
        And when he finally knocked his own tray 
        off the table, that was the end of the puppet 
        show.
        The children knew that even though Mr. Bungle 
        was funny to watch, he wouldn't be much fun 
        to eat with.
        Phil knew that a Mr. Bungle wouldn't have 
        many friends. He wouldn't want to be like 
        Mr. Bungle.
        Later Miss Brown said it was time to for 
        the children who ate in the cafeteria to 
        go to lunch.
        She hoped there weren't any Mr. Bungles in 
        this room.
        Phil stopped to return a book to Miss Brown 
        while his friends went on to the lunchroom.
        He would have to catch up with them later.
        One his way to catch up with his friends, 
        Phil almost walked passed the boys' room.
        But he stopped and thought we're his hands 
        clean?
        No, they were a little dirty. Phil remembered 
        that Mr. Bungle didn't wash his hands.
        Mr. Bungle's hair was messy too.
        Phil didn't want to be like Mr. Bungle.
        Inside the boys' room, Phil was surprised 
        to see some of his friends washing their 
        hands too.
        Phil washed his hands well with lots of soap.
        Then he rinsed the soap off.
        Phil dried his hands well too. When he was 
        finished, he threw the paper towel in the 
        basket where it belonged.
        And then he made sure that his hair looked 
        neat.
        Now Phil and his friends were ready for lunch.
        There was a line of children waiting to get 
        into the lunchroom when Phil got there.
        He saw some boys he knew at the front of 
        the line.
        They waved for him to go up to the front 
        with them.
        But Phil didn't want to break into line as 
        Mr. Bungle did.
        So Phil went to the end. That was the fair 
        thing to do.
        He would see his other friends inside the 
        lunchroom.
        The line moved very fast, and soon Phil was 
        inside.
        First he picked up his tray.
        Then he got his silverware.
        He put his knife, fork and spoon neatly on 
        the tray.
        And then he slid his tray along.
        He always enjoyed looking at the good food 
        in the cafeteria.
        It tasted good and was good for him too.
        Instead of having a sandwich today, Phil 
        decided to take the hot lunch.
        Phil took some bread and butter too.
        And he knew what else he wanted: milk.
        But Alice took the last carton on the tray.
        Maybe there was more more milk, so he said, 
        "May I please have some milk?"
        Phil remembered to say "may I" and "please". 
        That was very polite.
        Yes, there was more milk.
        Phil remembered to say "thank you" when he 
        took the carton of milk.
        Phil had good manners. He didn't want to 
        be like Mr. Bungle in the lunchroom.
        Phil didn't want to forget his dessert.
        The cake looked delicious [and was huge!].
        At the end of the line, the lunchroom supervisor 
        said she had noticed how polite Phil was.
        And she smiled at him.
        She wouldn't smile at a Mr. Bungle.
        Phil went to table where his friends were.
        He put his tray down carefully, pulled out 
        his chair quietly and sat down.
        He knew his friends would like a noisy Mr. 
        Bungle at their table.
        There was someone Phil liked: Freddy.
        He always brought his lunch from home.
        It looked good.
        Freddy had a sandwich, and apple, a cookie, 
        and milk.
        Before Phil began to eat, he always put a 
        napkin on his lap.
        So did Freddy.
        Everyone liked Freddy. He was very polite.
        For example, if he had food in his mouth 
        when someone talked to him,
        he always took time to chew the food with 
        his mouth closed and swallow before he answered.
        Phil noticed how straight and tall Freddy 
        usually sat.
        Freddy kept his feet on the floor too.
        Phil would rather be like Freddy than like 
        Mr. Bungle.
        Another polite person everyone liked was 
        Alice.
        For example, when Alice sneezed, she covered 
        her mouth and nose. This protected her friends 
        at the table from any germs.
        While Phil and his friends ate, a boy ran 
        past their table.
        You shouldn't run in the lunchroom. Only 
        Mr. Bungle would do that.
        Phil and his friends wouldn't like to have 
        a Mr. Bungle at their table.
        Then lunchtime wouldn't be as much fun as 
        it is.
        Phil ate slowly and enjoyed his lunch.
        Finally, he had eaten everything except his 
        dessert.
        He saved his cake for last.
        Only a Mr. Bungle would eat his dessert before 
        he'd finished the rest of his lunch.
        And Phil wan't a Mr. Bungle.
        The cake was a lie.
        Phil drank his milk carefully.
        Some children are messy when they drink milk, 
        but not Phil.
        As each of Phil's friends finished, they 
        didn't leave the table but waited for all 
        the others to finish eating too.
        Phil was the last one done.
        His wiped his mouth and hands carefully with 
        his napkin.
        Then he cleaned the table where he sat.
        He didn't want to leave his place at the 
        table dirty.
        Everyone at the table cleaned his own place 
        well. But look at that table. It was left 
        very messy.
        Phil thought a Mr. Bungle must have sat there.
        But Phil didn't want to be like Mr. Bungle 
        so he put his chair neatly into place.
        And his table looked fine.
        Not a piece of paper or scrap of food was 
        left on it.
        No Mr. Bungle sat here!
        Phil's friends were careful to put their 
        waste papers and empty milk cartons where 
        they belonged.
        In this way, they helped keep the lunchroom 
        clean.
        Phil was certain that Mr. Bungle wouldn't 
        put his paper in the waste basket and his 
        empty carton on the milk tray.
        Mr. Bungle probably wouldn't bother to put 
        his lunch tray in the right place either.
        But Phil and his friends did.
        Lunch was good today. And then Miss Brown 
        told Phil and his friends how proud she was 
        of them.
        They had left their table the neatest in 
        the luchroom.
        No one here was a Mr. Bungle. And no one 
        wanted to be.
        Are you like Mr. Bungle? Mr. Bungle is ashamed 
        because he spoils lunchtime.
        Don't be like Mr. Bungle.
        Have good lunchtime manners and lunch will 
        be more fun for everyone.",

00:00:03.630 --> 00:00:06.540
One of the drawings that I did was I took from a

00:00:06.930 --> 00:00:10.170
researcher who talked about--she, she researches and

00:00:10.170 --> 00:00:16.890
studies businesses after disasters, and she was

00:00:16.890 --> 00:00:19.320
talking about how none of the businesses had any

00:00:19.320 --> 00:00:22.110
kind of natural disaster plan, that if it was

00:00:22.110 --> 00:00:25.230
anything, it was an unused manual on a shelf, and

00:00:25.230 --> 00:00:27.330
that was it. So I think that's one thing that's

00:00:27.330 --> 00:00:29.760
probably changed in that community now. But I

00:00:29.760 --> 00:00:33.600
think that's a lesson for all of us just to maybe

00:00:33.990 --> 00:00:37.050
spend a little time thinking ahead of time just to

00:00:37.050 --> 00:00:39.900
prepare for for the unexpected, the best that you

00:00:39.900 --> 00:00:44.760
can. What did you find from the question, you know, were

00:00:44.780 --> 00:00:49.230
people prepared for this fire? No. Most of them

00:00:49.230 --> 00:00:52.520
thought it could never happen. That it would have

00:00:52.520 --> 00:00:55.850
been stopped before it got into town.

00:00:57.940 --> 00:01:02.510
The only organization that had any kind of plan

00:01:02.510 --> 00:01:06.590
was a hotel chain, and that was a corporate

00:01:06.740 --> 00:01:10.970
disaster plan, but it wasn't specific to that

00:01:10.970 --> 00:01:15.650
locale or the disaster. But, many of them didn't

00:01:15.650 --> 00:01:19.910
have insurance that covered what they were finding

00:01:20.240 --> 00:01:26.060
they needed for recovery. So not, not a lot of pre-thinking

00:01:26.080 --> 00:01:31.340
about disasters. So the businesses that

00:01:31.340 --> 00:01:35.020
did have a disaster plan, how did they, you know,

00:01:35.090 --> 00:01:38.430
did they train their employees? No, they didn't.

00:01:38.450 --> 00:01:43.800
They just had a manual, and they really didn't sit

00:01:43.800 --> 00:01:47.160
down with their employees and show, or show them

00:01:47.160 --> 00:01:49.530
the manual and have them read it or train them

00:01:49.890 --> 00:01:53.550
from it. It was just a plan that was on somebody's

00:01:54.090 --> 00:01:54.720
bookshelf.

        Anknüpfend an eine bevorſtehende Interpellation der Sozial-
        demofkraten im Reichstag über die Gefangenhaltung der drei
        jungen Deutſchen in Moskau und andere deutſche Gefangene, die aus
        politiſchen Gründen in ruſſiſchen Gefängniſſen feſtgehalten würden,
        ſchreibt die „Jsweſtija“, dieſe Interpellation ſei durch die Or-
        ganiſation Conſul vorbereitet (!!), die durch Finanz-
        und Handelsfreiſe auf die Sozialdemokraten eingewirkt habe. Die
        „Jsweſtija“ beklagt ſich weiter über die Kampagne der deutſchen
        Blätter, welche die Beziehungen zu Sowjetrußland verſchlechtern
        ſolle, und fährt dann fort: „Wir ſind in der Lage, an Hand un-
        beſtreitbarer Dokumente, die der Sowjetregierung zur Verfügung
        ſtehen, nachzuweiſen, daß dieſe „jungen Gelehrten Fälſcher von
        Dokumenten und Spione ſind, die eine deutſche
        faſciſtiſche Organiſation zu terroriſtiſchen
        Zwecken nach Moskau abkommandierte . . . .“ „Die Or-
        ganiſation „Conſul“ hat - bereits 1923 beſchloſſen,
        ihre terroriſtiſche Tätigkeit auszudehnen und einen Plan
        ausgearbeitet für Attentate auf hervorragende kommuniſtiſche
        Staatsmänner in. Mos8kau. Im Dezember 1923 wurde eine
        Gruppe Karl Kindermann8 mit der Ausführung
        des Planes auf ruſſiſchem Boden beauftragt. Im Juli 1924 hatte ſie
        ſchon ganz beſtimmte Anweiſungen erhalten, deren erſte Opfer
        ſowjetruſſiſche Staat8männer in MoSkau ſein
        ſollten. Die „Jsweſtija“ behauptet, daß zur Maxsfierung ihrer
        Abſichten die jekt Verhafteten fich an die Kommuniſtiſche Partei
        heranmachten,“ uur in- die ton muniſtiſchen Kreiſe Moskaus einzu
        dringen. Sie fälſchten die Mitgliedskarten (Warum? Sie konnten
        ja ec<hte haben. D. Red.) und Beglaubigungskarten, wandten ſich
        an liberale Gelehrte Deutſchlands, „deren Empfehlungsſchreiben
        ihnen auch die Tür zum Arbeitszimmer Theodor Wolffs
        öffneten, der ſich einverſtanden erklärte, Korreſpondenzen aus Fern-
        Sibirien entgegenzunehmen, und einen Vorſchuß von 2000 Mark
        bewilligte“, Weiter wandten fich die Reiſenden an den Michael-
        Konzern und an das Modehaus Rudolf Herkog, die dafür Wirt-
        fſchafts8ſpionage (!) zu ihren Gunſten forderten. Veber die
        Perſonalien ſagte der Artikel: Dr. Karl Kindermann ſtudierte
        1922/23 Kriminalrecht, vervollſtändigte ſeine theoretiſchen Kenntniſſe
        im Dienſte eine8 Detektivbureaus in Berlin. Einige Beamte des
        Berliner Polizeipräſidiums können ausführlicher über ihn Auskunft
        geben. Max v. Ditmaringen, alias Ditmar, iſt Eſtländer und
        von der Organiſation „Conſul“ mit Terrorakten beauftragt. Der
        Artikel ſchließt mit der Hoffnung, daß die öffentliche Meinung aller
        Kreiſe in Deutſchland jeßt ihren Jrrtum einſehen, die Regierung die
        „Verleumder“ zum Schweigen bringen werde. Die im Reichstag
        geplante Interpellation verlange, wenigſtens nach ihrem Wortlaut,
        daß die deutſche Regierung die Befreiung der ge-
        fangengehaltenen Deutſc<en, ſofern es ſich nicht um
        ganz gewöhnliche Verbrecher handle, „in entſprechender Weiſe durch-
        jehen“" ſolle. Die Juterpellation ſei wohl kaum überlegt. Würde
        es in Deutſchland verſtanden werden, wenn die Sowjet-
        regierung von der deutſchen Regierung verlangte, daß ſie
        Sowjetſtaat8angehörige in Deutſchland gleichfalls freiließe, ledigvich
        weil ſie „nicht gewöhnliche Verbrecher ſind“? Jv Deutſchland
        ſive eine Anzahl Sowjetſtaatsangehöriger wegen politiſcher Ver-
        brechen, ohne daß bi8her eine Intervention der Sowjetregierung er
        folgt wäre. Die deutſche juriſtiſche Poſition werde durch derartige
        Forderungen gegenüber Sowjetrußland nur geſchwächt. Soweit
        die „I3weſtia“. WaZ3 die drei jungen Deutſ<en angeht, jo
        liegt eine amtliche öffentliche Mitteilung der Sowjetbehörden
        über ihren Fall immer noh nicht vor.“ Es iſt ſehr zu wünſchen,
        daß dis Unterſuchung möglichſt ſchnell beendigt wird und
        dann eine völlig öffentliche Gerichtsverhandlung
        folgt, falls das Endergebnis der gegenwärtigen Unterſuchung zur

        jeder Befragte, die Schwierigkeiten des Unternehmen3 vor.
        Wir kamen überein, daß ſie einiges über das Leben der Stu-
        denten an ſibiriſchen Univerſitäten ſchreiben ſollten, von denen,
        wie ihre Papiere bewieſen, eine Einladung an ſie ergangen

        wurde nur geſagt, daß ſie vermeiden müßten, ſich
        auf das Gebiet der Politik zu verirren. Nicht zu
        verkennen war, daß Kindermann und Wolſcht als Freunde
        auftraten, während zwiſchen ihnen und dem Balten v. Ditmar
        ein weniger intimes Verhältnis beſtand. Die beiden Deutſchen
        zeigten in der Unterhaltung, daß der Balte nur den Dolmetſch
        ſpielen ſolle, und hielten Diſtanz. Der Eindruck, den man bei
        flüchtiger Begegnung empfängt, kann folbſtverſtändlich trügen
        und darum habe ich verſucht, zuverläſſigere Auskünfte über
        die drei zu erlangen. Von dem Ditmar, der ein gutmütiges
        rundes Geſicht hatte, weiß man auch in den ſtudentiſchen Kreiſen
        nur zu ſagen, daß er ſich bald nach rechts, bald nach links, zu-
        leßt anſcheinend nach linf8, hat treiben laſſen und wahrſchein-
        lich mehr phantaſiert als gegeſſen hat. Für den Dr. Kinder-
        mann, der nach allen Zeugniſſen ſich mit den CE en
        Theorien befreundet zu haben ſcheint hat ſein ſchwer leiden-
        der Vater, ein Kaufmann in Durlach, ſchon mit leidenſchaft-
        lichen Worten an die Oeffentlichkeit appelliert. Ein ausge-
        zeichneter Univerſitätslehrer, Profeſſor in Tübingen, hat mir
        geſchrieben: „Dr. Kindermann iſt zweifellos nicht als Gegner
        nach Moskau gefahren, ſondern hat ſicherlich die ruſſiſchen
        Verhältniſſe weit eher in etwas illuſionärem Lichte geſehen.“
        Der Student Wolſcht iſt, wie ſeine Freunde ausſagen, gleich-
        falls von der rechten Seite nach links hinübergegangen, und
        mit ſo großer Entſchiedenheit, daß er, troß drücender Be-
        dürftigkeit, freiwillig eine Unterſtüßung zurü>wies, die er bis
        dahin von einem ihn zu reaktionär dünkenden Gönner erhielt.
        Statt weiterer Bekundungen will ich, mit einigen Kürzungen,
        die Schilderung hierher ſeen, die mir ſein Vater, ein in Bop-
        pard lebender ehemaliger Gymnaſialprofeſſor, entwirft:
        „Herzlichen Dank für Jhr Freundliches Schreiben, das mir
        68jährigem Mann ungemein wohlgetan hat. Was nun die hFe-
        wünſchten Aufflärungen über Theo angeht, ſo hängen dieſe mit
        meiner eigenen Stellung zur Kirche und zum Staate eng zu-
        ſammen. JH bin Anhänger der darwiniſtiſchen Theorie. Jn
        politiſcher Hinſicht bin ih Staat3ſozialiſt, wenn ich auch
        weder der ſozialdemokratiſchen noch kommuniſtſhen Partei ange-
        höre; ich dürfte ungefähr der Richtung de? „Berliner Tageblattes“"
        anzugliedern ſein, obwohl ich mich von jeder aktiven politiſchen
        Beteiligung biöher vollſtändig ferngehalten habe und ſeit meiner
        vor 17 Jahren nachgeſuchten und erhaltenen Penſionierung nur
        den Wiſſenſchaften gelebt habe. Jm übrigen tolerant
        laſſe ich jeden nach jeiner Manier ſelig werden. Sie werden es
        alfo verſtehen, daß ich meinem Sohn bei feinem im September
        vorigen Jahres erfolgten Beſuch keine Schwierigkeiten in den Weg
        gelegt habe, als er mir geſtand, daß er zur kommuni ſtiſchen
        Partei übergegangen ſei. Wer nicht rechts gehen kann,
        mag links gehen. Der Verluſt ſeines Vermögens durch die IJnfla1-
        tion, die ihn nötigte, ſich ſelbſt durchzuſchlagen, mag wohl nebſt
        der Bekanntſchaft mit zahlreichen ruſſiſchen und deutſchen Kom-
        muniſten die Hauptveranlaſſung dazu geweſen ſein. Außerdem
        hat ihn eine Nede des früheren Rektors der Univerſität erbittert,
        der öffentlich erklärte, er wolle keine Werkſtudenten haben. Aus
        allen dieſen Gründen hat Theo mit ſeinen früheren Anſchauungen
        gebrochen und ſogar, wie er mir erzählte, in kommuniſti-
        ſchen Kreiſen in Berlin einen Vortrag über E ntwi>klu ng
        des Sozialismus gehalten. Wenn Theo ſeine offizielle An-
        meldung bei der kommuniſtiſchen Partei, Wm ſeine Einſchrei-
        bung als Mitglied verſäumt hat, ſo iſt dies wohl hauptſächlieh der
        Bummelei zuzuſchreiben; daß er fich nicht angemeldet haben ſoll,
        wundert mich übrigens.
        1922 war Theo mit meiner Zuſtimmung auf Veranlaſſung ſeines
        ehemaligen Prinzipals (Theo hat vor dem <emiſchen Studium einen
        praktiſchen Kurſus auf einem Rittergut in einer Brennerei durch»
        gemacht, war auch ein Jahr als Tiſchlerlehrling bei einem
        Meiſter in Heſſiſch-Oldendorf, da ich hn urſprünglich für das Vau-
        fach beſtimmt hatte. Schon dieſe Art der Vorbildung hat ſicher auf
        feine kommuniſtiſche Geſinnung und Arbeiterfreundlichkeit Ein-
        fluß gehabt) bei einer ſchlagenden Verbindung eingetreten, hat einige
        Menſuren ausgefochten und hat ſich vollſtändig anderen Kreiſen zu-
        gewendet. Aus Mangel an Mitteln hat er wochenlang im Studenten-
        heim faſt nur von troFenem Brot gelebt in bitterſter Armut,
        da ich damals in der Inflation8periode nicht imſtande war, ihn zu
        unterſtüßen, weil ich z. B. in einem Monat (1923) ſage und ſchreibe
        10 Pf. Penſion erhielt, ſo ſehr war das Geld entwertet, als es in
        meine Hände kam. Theo hat mit ſeinen Kameraden ſein leßtes3
        Stü> Brot geteilt; er war außerordentlich beliebt und eine
        biedere, allzu gutmütige Seele. Sein Hauptfehler iſt Mangel an
        Vorſicht. Im übrigen iſt er eine praktiſche Natur. Mit ſeinem
        mehr wiſſenſchaftlich veranlagten Freunde Kindermann hat er ge-
        meinſchaftlich das Neiſeprojekt entworfen, von dem er ſich durch Film-
        aufnahmen günſtige pekuniäre Reſultate verſprach. Hauptgrund aber
        war bei beiden ein ungezügelter Reiſetrieb und Abenteuerluſt.
        Beiden fehlte die nötige Erfahrung und Kenntnis der Zuſtände
        in Rußland.
        Kap Tſcheljuſkin und das vulkaniſche Kamtſchatka hat ſie be-
        onders angeloc>t. Die Tſcheka hat dieſe Angaben zu der Anklage
        benußt, daß ſie Mitglieder der Orgeſch ſeien, die mit Weißgardiſten
        in Verbindung ſtänden. Bekanntlich haben vor einiger Zeit in
        Kamtſchatka erbitterte Kämpfe zwiſchen Weißgardiſten und der
        Roten Armee ſtatgefunden. Doch davon hatten die beiden harm-
        loſen Studenten gar keine Ahnung. Daß Theo größere Kenntnis
        von den Plänen Ditmars gehabt habe als Kindermann iſt Un-
        ſinn. Theo und Ditmar ſtanden, wie Vater Kindermann
        ſchreibt, wie Hund und Kaß. An Ditmars Schuld glaube
        ich niht. Für die Wahrheit der von mir über Theo gemachten
        Angaben ſtehe ich unbedingt ein."
